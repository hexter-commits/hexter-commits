- ⚡ Fun fact: The first computer "bug" was an actual bug! In 1947, computer scientist Grace Hopper and her team found a moth trapped in the relay of the Harvard Mark II computer, causing an error. They removed it and recorded it as the first "bug" in computing history. Although the term "bug" had been used before in engineering to describe mechanical glitches, this incident is credited with popularizing the term in the context of computing!
